# OpenCV_TLP_Benchmark

This repository contains the code to analyse the tracking algoritms contained in OpenCV, 
according to the TLP benchmark. The TLP benchmark is a way of testing and evaluating object tracking algorithms, 
focused on long term tracking analysis. This aim of this project is the evaluation of the OpenCV tracking algorithms, 
present in version 4.3.0, with the exclusion of the GOTURN algorithm.
